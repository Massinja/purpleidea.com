If you like my blog, and you like my <a title="code" href="https://github.com/purpleidea/">code</a>, please leave me a <a href="https://paypal.me/purpleidea" target="_blank">tip</a>!

You can also donate money via my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/purpleidea).

Funds and other resources give me more time to spend on code and articles for you!

I'm often in need of hardware, so if you have something you can donate or sponsor, please let me know.

If your company wants to fly me somewhere to come hack on my code in your office, that could be arranged.
Maybe you need help installing it, integrating it, or adding a feature?

If you'd like to send me to attend and/or speak at a conference, that could be nice too!

Other forms of payment can be arranged.

<a href="/contact/" >Let me know...</a>

Happy hacking,

James
