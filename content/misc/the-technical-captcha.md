title: The Technical CAPTCHA
draft: false
---

This was intended to be a [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) for recruiters.

#### **The CAPTCHA**

1. Comment or write a question on one of my [technical articles](/blog/).
2. [Contact me](/contact/).
3. If your comment was good, you'll get a reply back!

It need not be long, but you do get points for *cleverness* if it asks an interesting question, or makes light of a fun corner case that I haven't covered.
The *clever* part about this, is that you get to think of it as a way of quizzing me, and I get to engage with people whose interest is technology.

I hope you enjoy this idea, and thank you for completing the _Technical CAPTCHA_.

Happy Hacking,

James
