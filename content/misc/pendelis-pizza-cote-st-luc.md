Their telephone operator usually sounds very unhappy, but their pizza is fairly good.
Ask them not to burn it! I recommend the "cheese and tomato", aka plain.
Tell them *The Technical Blog of James* sent you.

Here's the most recent menu:

<br />
{{< figure src="pendelis-1.png" link="pendelis-1.png" width="100%" height="100%" >}}

I posted this because there's no menu to be found online.

Happy Hacking!
