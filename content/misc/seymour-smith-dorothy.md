My favourite piece of piano music is called
"[_Dorothy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy)" by "_Seymour Smith_". My
grandmother [[1]](#footnotes[1]) used to play it to me when I was young. When
she died, I asked if I could keep the piano music.

If you know anything about Seymour Smith, have a copy of any of his sheet music,
or would like to send me a recording of _Dorothy_ of any of his other music,
please [contact](/contact/) me.

[Someone on the internet even took the time to make a recording of the piece.](#video)

[I've scanned in my originals to share.](#leona)
