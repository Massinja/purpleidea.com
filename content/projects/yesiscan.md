**yesiscan** is a tool for performing automated license scanning. It takes many
forms of user input, then runs a bunch of different analysis tools in parallel,
and finally produces a customizable report which can easily be shared with your
team. It has been designed to make license analysis simple for users, and easy
to manage and configure for centralized legal teams.

It can be used via a CLI, web ui, http API, or even imported as a library and
built into your existing software.

It was initially developed for [Amazon](https://github.com/awslabs/yesiscan/)
when I was working for their [OSPO](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-does-open-source-program-office-do).

### Reports

It can produce reports that make it easy to identify particular licenses or
families of licenses.

These can be automatically stored in a centralized manner, or shared directly
with any interested parties. The reports can be customized to meet the
reporting needs of your organization.
