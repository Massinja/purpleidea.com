<a href="/post/">The Technical Blog of James</a> was seen on an outdoor electronic display in downtown Montreal! Thanks to one of my readers for sending this in.

If you've got access to a large electronic display, put up the blog, snap a photo, and send it my way! I'll post it here and send you some random stickers!

Happy Hacking,

James
