I'll be giving a talk at <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x">SCALE</a> today about automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster and Vagrant. I'll be giving some live demos, and this will cover some of the material from:

<a href="/post/2014/01/08/automatically-deploying-glusterfs-with-puppet-gluster-vagrant/">Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster + Vagrant!</a>

and it will contain excerpts from:

<a href="/post/2014/01/27/screencasts-of-puppet-gluster-vagrant/">Screencasts of Puppet-Gluster + Vagrant</a>

I'll also be talking about some new upcoming features, and am happy to answer all of your questions!

The talk will be part of <a href="http://www.infranext.org/?page_id=18">Infrastructure.next</a> and is starting around 1:30 or 2pm in the <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/schedule/friday">Century AB</a> room.

If you're not able to attend, or you'd like a more personalized demo, send me a <a href="/post/contact/">note</a>! I'll be around for the next few days.

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jzb">Joe Brockmeier</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmark">John Mark Walker</a> for hosting the event and sending me here.

Happy Hacking,

James
