Fedora did a lovely job of updating me to the latest versionÂ (v. 20) of <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>. One problem I found, was that scrolling on certain pages was quite jerky. Performance was worse (or more likely) on pages with a frameset, and pages which were long. Pages with many images made this problem worse.

It turns out that the workaround is to disable hardware acceleration:

After you've unchecked this box, restart Firefox, and scrolling is now considerably smoother.

Hopefully this helped you out. Most likely there is some driver issue or deficiency with the X drivers. I'm using an excellent Thinkpad X201. I've also had at least two cases of X freezing while I was manipulating a Firefox window, so perhaps this is related, and hopefully this won't happen to me anymore.

Happy hacking,

James
