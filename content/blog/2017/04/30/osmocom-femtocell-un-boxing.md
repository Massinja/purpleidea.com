<a href="https://twitter.com/LaF0rge">LaForge</a> and the fine folks at <a href="https://osmocom.org/">Osmocom</a> (<a href="https://www.sysmocom.de/">Sysmocom</a>) <a href="https://osmocom.org/news/62">recently had a femtocell giveaway</a>. I didn't expect to have much time to hack on things, but they were still quite generous in sending me one. It arrived, and I took some un-boxing photos for anyone who is curious.

I'm very excited about the work the project is doing in their efforts to create and support free software telephony. If you are a telecom, please check out the various <a href="https://www.sysmocom.de/">Sysmocom products and services available</a>.

Happy Hacking,
